# DDPCourseProject
Submission for the Course Project of the Developing Data Products Course 
Re-uploaded while trying to understand fetch push better

Deleted some repositories to understand how commiting works and whether or not it stays even if you delete a repo online.
Had to re-upload a couple of times to test different experiments. This was originally uploaded the 16th of September 2015
as part of the Coursera DSS course - Developing Data Products. The shiny app associated with this can be found at
